# C++ Practice Problems

This repository contains my practice problems for my semester exams in C++. Each file represents my attempts to solve different C++ problems.

## File Naming Conventions

- **`a1.cpp`, `a2.cpp`, `a3.cpp`, etc.**: These files represent my first attempt at solving a specific problem.
- **`aa1.cpp`, `aa2.cpp`, `aa3.cpp`, etc.**: These files represent my second attempt at solving the same problem.

## Structure

The repository is organized with files that follow a consistent naming convention to track my progress through multiple attempts at each problem. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process and improvements as I practice and prepare for my C++ exams. Each file demonstrates a different approach or refinement of my solution.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the files to see the different strategies I've employed to solve these problems. You can compile and run any of the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler like `g++`.

Example:

```bash
g++ a1.cpp -o a1
./a1
